Revision history for Perl extension AI::Calibrate.

1.5   Fri Aug 3 2012
      - Changes to ./t/AI-Calibrate-1.t to let it pass with almost-equal
        numbers.

1.4   Thu Aug 2 2012
      - Revised calibration algorithm based on bug
      - Updated tests in ./t
      - Added ./t/AI-Calibrate-KL.t using Kun Liu's dataset.
      - Added ./t/AI-Calibrate-pathologies.t to test for pathological cases.

1.3   Fri Nov 4
      - Removed dependency on Test::Deep, added explicit declaration of
        dependency on Test::More to Makefile.PL

1.2   Thu Nov 3
      - Fixed test ./t/AI-Calibrate-NB.t so that test wouldn't fail.  Used to
        call is_deeply, which was failing on slight differences between
        floating point numbers.  Now compares with a small tolerance.

1.1   Thu Feb 28 19:00:06 2008
      - Added new function print_mapping
      - Added new test file AI-Calibrate-NB.t which, if AI::NaiveBayes1 is
        present, trains a classifier and calibrates it.

1.0   Thu Feb 05 11:37:31 2008
      - First public release to CPAN.
