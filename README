AI-Calibrate version 1.0
=========================

AI::Calibrate - Perl module for producing probabilities from classifier scores

In AI, classifiers usually return some sort of an instance score with their
classifications.  These scores can be used as probabilities in various
calculations, but first they need to be calibrated.  Naive Bayes, for example,
is a very useful classifier, but the scores it produces are usually "bunched"
around 0 and 1, making these scores poor probability estimates.  Support
vector machines have a similar problem.  Both classifier types should be
calibrated before their scores are used as probability estimates.  This module
calibrates a classifier using the Pool Adjacent Violators algorithm.
